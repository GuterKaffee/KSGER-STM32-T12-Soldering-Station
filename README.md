# KSGER STM32 T12-Soldering Station

Here you find my redrawn Schematics of the KSGER STM32 T12 Ver. 2.1S.
Schematics were adopted from eevblog floobydust. Minor changes were done
e.g. Q4 was exchanged. 

I am aiming at modifying the Schematics to increase the power to 200 W 
to facilitate recent T245 soldering tips from Aixun. 

## Present state:
- Untested Prototype   
Feel free, to forge & build it. Feadback would be nice. I am going to
build it by end of this year. At that point, I will create a first release
including precompiled firmware and publish the project on EasyEDA.


## Open issues:
- Some capacitor values are missing
- Design a 200 W 24 V Power supply
- Draw PCBs
- Build and test it


## Recent changes: 
- Schematics were added and component prefixes were corrected.
- Connector names were corrected 

 
## Known issues:
- Some capacitor values are missing
