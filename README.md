# KSGER STM32 T12-Soldering Station

Here you find my redrawn Schematics of the KSGER STM32 T12 Ver. 2.1S.
Schematics were adopted from eevblog floobydust. Minor changes (component replacements) were done.
I am not going to continue redrawing the PCB, since I am aiming at 
developing a new 200 W soldering station based on the T245 handle!
